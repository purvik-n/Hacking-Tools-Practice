Day 14 – NetBIOS Scan Tool

NetBIOS = Network Basic Input/Output System
Used for communication between devices in local networks.

Runs on:
Port 137 → NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS)
Port 138 → NetBIOS Datagram Service
Port 139 → NetBIOS Session Service

Purpose:
- Name resolution (computer names)
- File & printer sharing (older Windows networks)
- Device discovery in LAN

Why NetBIOS is Important in Cybersecurity:
- Often enabled in internal networks
- Can leak system information
- Useful for enumeration phase

Common NetBIOS Scanning Tools:

1. nbtstat (Windows)
nbtstat -A <target_ip>

2. nbtscan (Linux / Kali)
nbtscan <target_ip>
nbtscan 192.168.1.0/24

3. Nmap NetBIOS Scripts
nmap -p 137 --script nbstat <target>

Information You Can Get:
- Computer name
- Workgroup name
- Logged-in user
- MAC address

Security Risks:
- Information disclosure
- Null session attacks
- Lateral movement opportunities

Difference:
NetBIOS = Older name service protocol
SMB = File sharing protocol (often works with NetBIOS in older systems)

Important Concept:
NetBIOS enumeration is part of internal network reconnaissance.

Reminder:
Mostly useful in LAN penetration testing.
Less common in modern internet-facing systems.
