Day 18 – Steghide Tool

Steghide = Steganography tool
Used to hide secret data inside image or audio files.

Concept:
Steganography = Hiding data inside another file
(Not encryption, but concealment)

Supported File Types:
- JPEG
- BMP
- WAV
- AU

Purpose:
- Hide sensitive data
- CTF challenges
- Digital forensics practice
- Data concealment testing

Basic Commands:

Hide a file inside image:
steghide embed -cf image.jpg -ef secret.txt

Extract hidden data:
steghide extract -sf image.jpg

View file info:
steghide info image.jpg

Important Terms:
Carrier file → Image/audio file used to hide data
Embedded file → Hidden file
Passphrase → Password used to protect hidden data

How It Works:
- Modifies least significant bits (LSB) of file
- Human eye cannot detect the change

Why It Is Important in Cybersecurity:
- Used in data exfiltration
- Used in malware communication
- Common in CTF & forensic investigations

Detection Methods:
- File size comparison
- Hash comparison
- Steganalysis tools

Difference:
Encryption → Scrambles data
Steganography → Hides existence of data

Key Concept:
If encryption hides content,
steganography hides existence.
