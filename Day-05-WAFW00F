# Day 05 – WAFW00F Practice

## 📅 Date
17 Feb 2026

## 🛠 Tool
WAFW00F

## 🎯 Goal of Learning
Understand how to detect the presence of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on a target website.

## 📚 What I Learned Today
- What a Web Application Firewall (WAF) is
- Why WAF detection is important in reconnaissance
- How WAFW00F identifies different WAF technologies
- Basic command usage of WAFW00F

## ⚙️ Practice Done
- Ran WAFW00F against test websites
- Observed detected WAF types
- Analyzed how responses change when a WAF is present

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Firewall Detection
- HTTP Response Analysis
- Reconnaissance Phase

## 🔥 My Notes
Before testing a web application, it is important to check if a WAF is protecting it.  
WAFW00F helps identify the type of firewall, which affects testing strategies.

## 🚀 Next Step
Study how different WAFs block malicious requests and understand basic bypass concepts (theory only).
