Day 10 – Nmap (Network Mapper)

Nmap = Network scanning & enumeration tool
Used for:
- Discovering hosts
- Port scanning
- Service detection
- OS detection
- Vulnerability scanning (basic)

Basic Syntax:
nmap <target>

Examples:
nmap 192.168.1.1
nmap 192.168.1.0/24
nmap -p 80 192.168.1.1
nmap -p 1-1000 192.168.1.1

Important Scan Types:
-sT → TCP Connect Scan
-sS → SYN (Stealth) Scan
-sU → UDP Scan
-sn → Ping Scan (Host discovery)

Service & OS Detection:
-sV → Detect service version
-O  → Detect OS
-A  → Aggressive scan (OS + version + script + traceroute)

Port States:
Open → Service running
Closed → No service
Filtered → Blocked by firewall

Useful Combinations:
nmap -sS -sV 192.168.1.1
nmap -A <target>

Important Concept:
Reconnaissance & enumeration are the most critical phases in penetration testing.

Remember:
Masscan = Speed
Nmap = Detailed analysis
