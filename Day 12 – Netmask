Day 12 – Netmask (Subnet Mask)

Netmask = Defines which part of an IP address is Network ID and Host ID.

Purpose:
- Divides network into subnets
- Controls IP address allocation
- Determines number of hosts in a network

IPv4 Structure:
IP Address = Network Portion + Host Portion

Example:
IP: 192.168.1.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
CIDR Notation: /24

Common Subnet Masks:
255.0.0.0      → /8
255.255.0.0    → /16
255.255.255.0  → /24
255.255.255.128 → /25

CIDR Meaning:
/24 → 24 bits for network, 8 bits for host

Host Formula:
2^n - 2
n = number of host bits

Example:
/24 → 8 host bits
2^8 - 2 = 254 usable hosts

Why "-2"?
1 IP = Network address
1 IP = Broadcast address

Important Terms:
Network Address → First IP in subnet
Broadcast Address → Last IP in subnet
Usable Hosts → Between network & broadcast

Why Netmask is Important in Hacking:
- Helps identify target network range
- Used in scanning (Nmap, Masscan)
- Required for subnetting attacks & enumeration

Remember:
More network bits → Less hosts
More host bits → More hosts
