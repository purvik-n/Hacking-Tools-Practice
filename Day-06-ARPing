# Day 06 – ARPing Practice (Live Host Identification)

## 📅 Date
17 Feb 2026

## 🛠 Tool
ARPing

## 🎯 Goal of Learning
Understand how ARP-based scanning works and how to identify live hosts in a local network.

## 📚 What I Learned Today
- What ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is
- Difference between ARP scan and ICMP ping
- How ARPing helps in identifying active devices
- Why ARP scanning works well in local networks

## ⚙️ Practice Done
- Ran ARPing on local network IP ranges
- Identified active/live hosts
- Observed MAC addresses of detected devices
- Compared ARP response vs normal ping response

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- ARP Protocol
- MAC Address
- Local Network Scanning
- Live Host Discovery
- Layer 2 Communication

## 🔥 My Notes
ARPing is useful for detecting live hosts inside a local network.  
Unlike ICMP ping, ARP-based detection works even if ping is blocked.

## 🚀 Next Step
Combine ARP-based scanning with other network reconnaissance tools to map network devices.
