Day 15 – Introduction to Enumeration

Enumeration = Active information gathering process
It is the phase after scanning in penetration testing.

Definition:
Enumeration is the process of extracting detailed information from a target system.

Difference:
Scanning → Finds open ports
Enumeration → Identifies services, users, shares, versions, and vulnerabilities

Goal of Enumeration:
- Identify users
- Identify services & versions
- Discover shared resources
- Extract system information
- Find attack surface

Common Services Enumerated:
- SMB
- NetBIOS
- FTP
- SSH
- DNS
- SNMP
- LDAP

Common Enumeration Tools:
Nmap (scripts)
enum4linux
smbclient
nbtscan
rpcclient
theHarvester

Example Nmap Enumeration:
nmap -sV <target>
nmap -A <target>
nmap --script vuln <target>

Why Enumeration is Critical:
- Most important phase in hacking
- Reveals misconfigurations
- Identifies weak credentials
- Helps in privilege escalation

Important Concept:
The more information collected,
the easier the exploitation phase becomes.

Penetration Testing Flow:
1. Reconnaissance
2. Scanning
3. Enumeration
4. Exploitation
5. Post-exploitation

Key Mindset:
Enumeration is about being patient and detailed.
Small information leaks can lead to full system compromise.
