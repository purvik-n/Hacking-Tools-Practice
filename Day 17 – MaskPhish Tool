Day 17 – MaskPhish Tool

MaskPhish = Phishing URL masking tool
Used to create shortened and disguised phishing links.

Purpose:
- Social engineering testing
- Awareness demonstrations
- Educational lab practice

How It Works:
- Takes original phishing URL
- Masks it with a legitimate-looking domain
- Generates a shortened social engineering link

Example Concept:
Original: http://malicious-site.com/login
Masked: https://google.com-login-security-update.com

Why It Is Dangerous:
- Tricks users into clicking
- Used in credential harvesting attacks
- Exploits human psychology

Common Use Case in Pentesting:
- Red team social engineering simulations
- Phishing awareness campaigns
- Testing employee awareness

Important Concepts:
Phishing = Human-based attack
Social Engineering = Manipulating human trust

Risks:
- Illegal if used without permission
- Can cause serious legal consequences
- Considered cybercrime outside lab/testing scope

Defensive Measures:
- Always verify domain names carefully
- Check HTTPS certificate
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Avoid clicking unknown links
- Use email filtering systems

Key Learning:
Human vulnerability is often weaker than technical security.
Cybersecurity is not just about systems — it is about people.

Ethical Reminder:
Only study for awareness and defense.
Never use for real-world phishing attacks.
