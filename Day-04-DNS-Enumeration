# Day 04 – DNS Enumeration Practice

## 📅 Date
17 Feb 2026

## 🛠 Tool / Concept
DNS Enumeration

## 🎯 Goal of Learning
Understand how DNS enumeration is used during the reconnaissance phase to gather information about a target domain.

## 📚 What I Learned Today
- What DNS enumeration means
- How attackers gather DNS-related information
- Identifying subdomains
- Extracting DNS record details
- Understanding target infrastructure through DNS data

## ⚙️ Practice Done
- Performed DNS lookups on target domains
- Checked A, AAAA, MX, NS, and TXT records
- Explored subdomain discovery techniques

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- DNS Enumeration
- Subdomain Discovery
- Zone Transfer (basic concept)
- Information Gathering
- Reconnaissance Phase

## 🔥 My Notes
DNS enumeration is a critical step in reconnaissance.  
It helps reveal subdomains, mail servers, name servers, and other infrastructure-related information that can be useful in security testing.

## 🚀 Next Step
Practice automated DNS enumeration using security tools and understand zone transfer risks.
